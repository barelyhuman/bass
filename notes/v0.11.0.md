Quick relevant life update: I work at [Dagger] now. ðŸ¥³

Dagger solves the same problems as Bass, but it's an API instead of a language.
If you're interested in what Bass can do but you don't wanna learn a new
language, Dagger might be a better fit. You can check the [Dagger docs] to see
if there's already an SDK for your preferred language.

This release of Bass adds a [Dagger runtime] I've been building to dogfood the
[Dagger Go SDK] and core API. There are a few pieces missing so it's not quite
a drop-in replacement for the [Buildkit runtime] yet, but it's looking like a
perfect fit!

Aside from all that, this release is a grab bag of assorted features:

* 5 new bindings: `concat`, `take-all`, `collect`, `assert`, `strings:length`
* 2 new protocols: `:lines`, `:tar`
* 1 deprecated binding: `append` (replaced by `concat`)

...plus a few other fixes and tweaks. All the details are below.

See you next time!
